         <p class="wtext">Look, I am one of those people who doesn't want to work. And this website has these wierd math challenges that make me work, and I don't want to do it.<br>
         So, I, after some expirementing, found the best hack ever. There was a hack before, but the fixed it, and that really sucks. This hack is hard. You need to know some technical knowledge,<br>
         and I hope that you enjoy the fruits of my labor.<br><br></p>
         <p class="wtext">To get started, you need Chrome. Google Chrome. There is no other way. On a chromebook, please log in as Guest to get the function I want from you, or there is no hope for you<br>
         Anyway, go into your Mastery challenge, or challenge in a math mission. (I haven't tried any other approches for this, so please email me with any discoveries.)<br>
         Then Inspect the element. Inspect anywhere. Don't change anything. (It won't matter anyway.) Go to the tab ontop of the code, and click Network.<br>
         Then go to the top of the Network section, you should see checkboxes. Click <span class="gtext">Preserve Log</span>. What this does is it preserves all data that flows through the webpage.<br>
         Then refresh and re-inspect. Go to Network and you will see all the new files and data that passes through. Here's where it gets hard<br><br>
         Find the file in there, (usually near the bottom) that says <span class="gtext">assessment_item?last_seen_problem_sha</span><br>
         (Ingnore the string of numbers behind the name.) Click it. You should see:<br></p>

         <p class="wtext"><br>Now, this is only an example. The real meat is in the ItemData variable. Look, you can see the question there. If you scroll to the side some, you will eventually get<br>
         A widget array, inside which is a numeric_input array, inside of which is a answers array. Look at the answers array. The "value" part is the answer. Then all you must do is go to the page, <br>
         type the answer (It dosen't type it for you) and click the button, Ta-da! Correct, and it saves it as correct. Simple.</p>
