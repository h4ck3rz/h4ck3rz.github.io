      <p class="wtext">    The command prompt is a hacker's greatest tool. It can access almost anything in the system, including other files.
      It can change passwords and deviate the admins from the guests. Once it is in your control, you can do anything, from writing and setting
      up viruses, to<br>
      creating your own chat network inside of the computer network. You can even change the admin password. (Not reccommended, you might get caught.)
      The command prompt is basically the window into the os. The way the eyes are the window to the soul in humans, the command prompt is the window to<br>
      the os. The command prompt is basically a black box terminal with a few words on it.</p>
      <p class="gtext">
        
        C:/Windows/System32/>
        
      </p>
      <p class="wtext">This is what you should see. The "C:/" is the windows hard drive directory, or the main core of the computer. The windows folder holds<br>
      some of the more valuable things in it, such as the precious System folders that create the os. Lets learn some commands.</p>
      <p class="gtext">
        
        C:/Windows/System32/>dir
        
      </p>
      <p class="wtext">The dir command lists all folders and files in the directory. You can move around by using the cd command. The cd command is used like thsi:</p>
      <p class="gtext">
        
        C:/Windows/System32/>cd x
        C:/Windows/System32/>cd ..
        
      </p>
      <p class="wtext">The first way moves you up a directory, in this case to "X". But the .. moves you back into a former directory. With this you can move around and look at files.<br>
      But some directories will be restricted. Go into them with the WINDOWS 7 LOOPHOLE. But now we will work on another command. The start command.</p>
      <p class="gtext">
        
        C:/Windows/System32/x/>start program.exe
        C:/Windows/System32/x/>taskkill program.exe
