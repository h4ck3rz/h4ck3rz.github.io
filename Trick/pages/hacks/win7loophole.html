        <p class="wtext">The Win 7 loophole is famously awesome. It has the power to control an entire computer, and is the easiest acess point I know of for Windows. <br>
        The loophole involves some time. About 30 minutes at the least. 1 hour at the most. The loophole is the fact that there is a bug in the Windows 7 operating system, <br>
        this bug is the System Repair Program. SRP. The SRP repairs the system if it glitches. But it can't repair this bug, (luckily), to get this SRP, turn on the computer, <br>
        and then turn it off. Fast. Then the SRP should start up, to repair the "crash". Click the "Launch Startup Repair" And wait.</p>

        <p class="wtext">Then afterward, it should start...</p>

        <p class="wtext">Then it will ask you to restore defaults. Click cancel. After a bit, it will run, and soon this will pop up.</p>

        <p class="wtext">Click cancel, and it will run for 20 minutes. After the wait is over, this will pop up...</p>

        <p class="wtext">Click view problem details. Scroll down until you get to a X:// directory. Click it.</p>

        <p class="wtext">Then navigate into the C:/ directory, go into the windows folder. Navigate as such into the C:/Windows/System32/ and open your view to "all files"<br>
Then what will happen is that you should find the sticky keys program, called "sethc.exe". Change the name to "abc.exe" or something. Then find the "cmd.exe"<br>
Copy it and change the copy's name to "sethc". Then exit the window and shut down and restart the computer normally. This will open up a Admin command prompt without the admin password.<br>
If you know any CMD commands, you can do whatever.</p>
