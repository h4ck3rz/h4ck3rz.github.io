        CommanderKiller was the first to join the cause, giving me some important info. He doesn't know too much about the hacking actually, but<br>
        he is a great informer on vulnerabilities, and helps recruit some peeps to the cause. He's a great asset to the OPERATION.</p>

        64V1n is one of our best agents, simply because he is an agent. He is good at rallying people, and is a main part of TH3 H4ND's operations<br>
