        <p class="ptext" style="font-size: 20px;">Ok, loyal h4ck3rz, today we begin operation CHIPPEWA. Yes, we are going to attack the middle school. Why?<br>
        Because we want freedom. Control. And unblocked gaming sites. This operation has risks, and we are going to have all of them. Power to<br>
        the students!</p>

        <h4 class="TITLE" style="color:#9500bf; font-size:25px;">OP:chippewa: HOW TO?</h4>
        <p class="ptext" style="font-size: 20px;">Now, you all must be saying? How do we hack Chippewa? Well, I with my technical knowledge we can do it.<br>
        There is a hole. A small, tiny loophole. Library computers. The computers are actually our opening. They have Win 7 operating systems, and those<br>
        can be hacked easily. Read up on some of my knowledge, and we can get started...</p>

        <p class="ptext">Hey guys. We are going under some development currently. We are changing our page, adding some things. Like our hacks list and our newest<br>
        hack. We are also building a current HALL OF HEROS page to honor the peeps that are joining us by posting some new hacks to add. UPDATE: OP CHIPPEWA needs someone<br>
        to find out how to stay annonymous and not get caught by the IT peeps. They will join CommanderKiller on the new HALL OF HEROS page. Thx. TheSageL out...</p>
